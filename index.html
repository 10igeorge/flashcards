            <h2 class='init_hidden' id='moduloDefTitle'>Modulo</h2>
            <p class='init_hidden' id='moduloDef'>In computing, the modulo operation finds the remainder after division of one number by another (sometimes called modulus).

Given two positive numbers, a (the dividend) and n (the divisor), a modulo n (abbreviated as a mod n) is the remainder of the Euclidean division of a by n. For instance, the expression "5 mod 2" would evaluate to 1 because 5 divided by 2 leaves a quotient of 2 and a remainder of 1, while "9 mod 3" would evaluate to 0 because the division of 9 by 3 has a quotient of 3 and leaves a remainder of 0; there is nothing to subtract from 9 after multiplying 3 times 3. (Note that doing the division with a calculator will not show the result referred to here by this operation; the quotient will be expressed as a decimal fraction.)</p>
            <h2 class='init_hidden' id='alertDefTitle'>Alert</h2>
            <p class='init_hidden' id='alertDef'>The alert() method displays an alert box with a specified message and an OK button.

An alert box is often used if you want to make sure information comes through to the user.

Note: The alert box takes the focus away from the current window, and forces the browser to read the message. Do not overuse this method, as it prevents the user from accessing other parts of the page until the box is closed.</p>
            <h2 class='init_hidden' id='plusEqualsDefTitle'>Plus Equals</h2>
            <p class='init_hidden' id='plusEqualsDef'>When used the "plus equals" operator allows you to add an argument to the base value of a variable and in turn set the variable to the new value. Example: "number = number + 1" is the same as "number += 1"</p>
            <h2 class='init_hidden' id='stringDefTitle'>String</h2>
            <p class='init_hidden' id='stringDef'>A string is a data type in JavaScript that stores a series of characters.</p>
            <h2 class='init_hidden' id='escapeDefTitle'>Escape Character</h2>
            <p class='init_hidden' id='escapeDef'>In computing and telecommunication, an escape character is a character which invokes an alternative interpretation on subsequent characters in a character sequence. An escape character is a particular case of metacharacters. Generally, the judgement of whether something is an escape character or not depends on context. For example, the "\" character before a set of parenthesis will remove the special value INSIDE of a string, so that it can be displayed.</p>
            <h2 class='init_hidden' id='booleanDefTitle'>Boolean</h2>
            <p class='init_hidden' id='booleanDef'>A boolean data type can either be 'true' or 'false', and can be used to complete logical steps.</p>
